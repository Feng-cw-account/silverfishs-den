### Corallary:
[[Corollary on ralationship between injective and kernel]]

## related concept
### generated important subgroup
[[Image of Homomorphism]]
[[Kernel of Homomorphism]]
### other
[[Normal Subgroup]]
## related
### [[Functor]]:
they are both arguing an relationship similar to [[Orthogonal]]
### usage
based on [[Image of Homomorphism|Image]], we defined what is [[Class]]--[[Coset]] who shares the **same Image**, and the [[Kernel of Homomorphism|Kernel]] tell us [[Coset|how to get the Class]].
